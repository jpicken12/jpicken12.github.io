# Zettelkasten Method

The Zettelkasten method is a powerful tool for thinking and note taking that was created by a guy called Niklas Luhmann. It is most commonly described as:

>A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It has hypertextual features to make a web of thought possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection.

There are 3 [[Principles of Zettelkasten]] that should be followed to remain true to the intention of this method.
