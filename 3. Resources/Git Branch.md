# Git Branch

A branch is a new/separate version of the main repository. i.e. you have a large project and need to update the design of it.

## Create a new branch
```git branch hello-world-images
```

## Change branches
Checkout is the command used to checkout of a branch and move to one specified on the command line

```git checkout hello-world-images
```
Use -b to create the branch and move to it if it doesn't exist
