# Feather sticks
Feather sticks are versatile firelighters and are good for accessing dry parts of the wood in the middle, even during damp conditions. The number of feathersticks needed depends on the conditions but for 4-6 is typical.

- Use dead, dry, standing wood
- Choose wood without knots or remove knotty sections
- Use long pieces to give yourself space to work and nice long curls
- Split the wood, into eights or quarters, using the battoning technique which is hitting the side of a knife down the grain of the wood
- Generate curls by moving the knife down the wood (moving away from body)
- Use the edges of the wood to create curls
- Always push the curl underneath the last one to ensure tight bunches, you don't want them far apart
- You want a nice mass of curls at the end of the stick with a thin neck
- Aim to finish at the same place each time
- Create really fine curls at the base of the curls to help light the stick

## Notes
During Alan's bushcraft weekend (1-3 Nov '24) I created a feather stick and lit it from a ferro-rod. During my first attempt, I found that I wasn't pushing the knife under the previous curl. This meant my curls where quite spaced out unlike the ones in the video which are bunched up.
