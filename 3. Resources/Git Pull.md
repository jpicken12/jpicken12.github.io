# Git Pull

Git pull is a combination of 2 commands, [[Git Fetch]] and [[Git Merge]]. 

Fetch gets the history of tracked changes on the branch/repo i.e. from a GitHub repo. Merge then combines the current branch with the specified branch.

Any time you start working on a project, you should get the most recent changes to your local repo.

Git pull combines these commands so you don't have to go through them and pulls all changes from a remote repository into the branch you are working on.

```
git pull origin
```
