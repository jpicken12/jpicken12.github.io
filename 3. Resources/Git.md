- Initialising Git on a folder makes it a repository and Git creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes.
- When a file is changed, added or deleted it is considered **modified**
- Select the modified files you want to **stage**
- The **staged** files are **committed**, which prompts git to store a **permanent** snapshot of the files
- Git allows you to see the full history of every commit
- It doesn't keep a copy of every file in every commit, but tracks the changes made
