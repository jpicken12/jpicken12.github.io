# Azure Advisor

Azure Advisor is a digital assistant that analyses resource configuration and usage telemetry to recommend solutions that can improve:

- cost
- reliability
- performance
- operational excellence
- security

There was a question in the AZ-900 practice test asking if Azure Advisor could give recommendations on how to secure Entra ID. The answer is no as there is a list of resources that Advisor provides security recommendations for. Entra ID is not one.
