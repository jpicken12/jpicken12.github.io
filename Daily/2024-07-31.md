- The Israeli's have [assassinated the political leader of Hamas](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ck7g0g4mk4zo) . Could this mark the start of wider conflict in the middle east?  
- Huw Edwards, until recently the BBCs lead news anchor, has [pleaded guilty to making indecent images of Children](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cmj260e54x7o) . CHILDREN for fucks sake, what is wrong with people.
- At work I still feel very demotivated by my role. I don't feel fulfilled in the *doing* and want to work with technology. Solving problems and fixing things.
