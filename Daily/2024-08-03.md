- Feeling tired, Harriet work up 5 times last night! She's LOVING swimming in the pool.
- I borrowed a trailer from Helen & Nick that attaches to the back of my push bike and I pull the kids along in it. They feel like royalty.
- There was a hornet in the lodge last night the size of a bloody banana!
