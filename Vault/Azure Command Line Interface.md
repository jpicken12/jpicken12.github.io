Azure CLI is a command line interface that can be installed on Windows, MacOS or linux and run from a shell i.e. cmd.exe, bash etc. It can also be run from a browser using Azure Cloud Shell.

Azure CLI commands are used to administrate and manage Azure resources by either running interactive commands or creating shell scripts.

The Azure CLI syntax follows this format:

``reference name` - `command` - `parameter` - `parameter value``
