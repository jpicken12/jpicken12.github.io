- Pwsh pipelines are about getting the output from one command to the input of another i.e. commandA | commandB
- Pwsh does this at the parameter level. Commands can accept input only on a parameter. Pwsh has to figure out which parameter set of commandB can accept output from commandA. This is called [[Pwsh parameter binding]]
