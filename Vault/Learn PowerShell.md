# Learn PowerShell

I found a [Learn PowerShell](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2j0_s2VJe2hzQuQyn6yfMS2olhhs4UnQ) video series on YouTube which seems like a good starting point following my first experimental script [[Applying JMESPath]] I need to understand the basic concepts of this programming language before jumping in further.

I'll take notes on each of the videos in the playlist
1. Learn PowerShell - Video & Blog Series
2. [[Learn and use PowerShell with just 3 commands]] 
3. [[Working with the PowerShell pipeline]]
4. [[PowerShell history and current state]] 
5. [[Getting setup for PowerShell development]] 
6. [[Working with PowerShell Variables]]
