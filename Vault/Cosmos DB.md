# Cosmos DB

Cosmos DB is primarily a non-relational database that supports multiple data models. It has some relational database features, such as SQL-like querying which confused me at first and I was unclear if it was relational or non-relational.

Key features are:

- low latency
- fast response times
- automatic and instant scalability 
- guaranteed speed at any scale

The following question came up in an AZ-900 practice test:

>A company needs to implement a solution in Azure. Below are the key requirements for this solution. No need for [[Schema]] or [[Index Management]] Ensure low latency access to data around the world.

There were 4 Azure services to pick from in the answers and Cosmos DB was the right one.
