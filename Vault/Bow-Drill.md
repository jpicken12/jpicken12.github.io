# Bow-Drill
# Collect
Need dry wood to create the set and very dry bits of bark and fine kindling for the tinder bundle. Various grades of fuel are required so we can go up through the gears and build the fire once the flame takes. 
# Build
## Spindle
Use a knife to remove the bark from a long piece of wood to make it cylindrical and smooth. It's really important to get this straight and round. Shallow point at one (maximising friction) end and a sharp point at the other (minimising friction).

## Hearth
Create a hearth that can sit on the ground, using a knife to flatten the stick, the aim is to make the hearth about as thick as the diameter of the drill. Make a hole in the hearth for the drill to fit into to create the friction.

## Bearing block
Use green wood to provide a bit of lubrication and something at least as hard as the friction part. Put a hole in for the sharp part of the spindle to fit in.

## Bow
Using a straight length of wood, create a notch to hold the bow string, like a when making a peg. Tie a loop at the end of some cordage and slide over the end of the bow into the notch. Cut the cordage to length and fit into a notch at the other end. You want a bit of give in the cordage. Twist the drill into the bow cordage.

# Lighting
## Prepare
Place the shallow point of spindle into the hearth hole and the sharp point into the bearing block at the top. Then move the spindle back and forth to create friction. You don't want to polish it, you need some abrasion in the hole.

## Light
Cut a wedge into the hearth, an eighth of a circle, like a slice of pie.
Prepare all materials, create a tinder bundle that's as fine and fibrous as possible. 

Using something like a piece of birch bark to collect the ember produced, get it up away from the ground quickly once it's produced. Allow the ember to consolidate into a nice clump, put it into the tinder bundle and squeeze, then blow like your whistling. Once you have a flame, invert it and put it down. Get some sticks onto it quickly.
