# Personal Thinking Tool

Another of the [[Principles of Zettelkasten]] is that this must be a personal thinking tool for it to be useful. By following these principles and writing notes in our own words, we reinforce learning and understanding. 

It is not a place to 'dump' information copied from websites, which is what I did in the beginning. Rather, you take the information, refer to it's source then create notes that are linked using [[Hyper-Textual]] links, follow the rules of [[Atomicity]] (capturing just one thought) and are personal because they are written in our own words. 

This principle of personal thinking brings us back to the quote in this note, [[Zettelkasten Method]], which describes the zettelkasten method.
