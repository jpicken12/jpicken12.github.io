# Hyper-Textual Zettelkasten

One of the [[Principles of Zettelkasten]] is for notes to link to each other, explain and expand on each others information. Some important points on this principle are:

- Create relationships between notes
- Prioritise connecting (not collecting)
- Individual notes are called Zettels and are the smallest building blocks of the zettelkasten
