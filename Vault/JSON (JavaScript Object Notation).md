# JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight, text-based, language-independent data interchange format. 

It can represent four primitive types:
- Strings
- Booleans
- Numbers
- Null

and 2 structured types:
- Objects
- Arrays

An object is an *unordered* collection of zero or more name/value pairs, where a name is a string and the value is a string, boolean, number, null, object or array.

An array is an *ordered* sequence of zero or more values.

There is a [[JSON Specification]] which defines rules of the format.
