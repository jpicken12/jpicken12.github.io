When using a cloud provider, youâ€™ll always be responsible for:

- The information and data stored in the cloud
- Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)
- The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization

The cloud provider is always responsible for:

- The physical datacenter
- The physical network
- The physical hosts

Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:

- Operating systems
- Network controls
- Applications
- Identity and infrastructure
