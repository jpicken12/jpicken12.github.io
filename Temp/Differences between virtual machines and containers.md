# Differences between virtual machines and containers

VMs abstract CPU and storage
VMs virtualise the hardware
Can only run one OS at a time
VM is emulating full computer which can be slow

Conatiners bundle single app and dependencies
Containers virtualise the operating system
deploys it as a unit to container host
Container host provides a standardized runtime environment which abstracts away operating system and infrastucture requierments
